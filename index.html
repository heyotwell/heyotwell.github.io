				<p>Leafly is the world's cannabis information resource . At Leafly from 2016-2017, I launched a rewritten version of the company's main business-facing product, and also launched both business- and consumer-facing products for a new strategic initiative. Although I also did UX design for each of these, my main role was primary product manager. I also managed the Leafly.com website's day to day bug triaging and feature roadmaps.</p>

				<p>My contributions included:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A ground-up redesign of Leafly Biz, our main business facing product. This is a tool for cannabis dispensaries to manage their Leafly listing, online menus, deals, and customer updates.</li>
					<li>For Leafly's Products & Brands initiative, I launched a version of Leafly Biz for Brands, and the consumer-facing <a href="http://www.leafly.com/products">Leafly Product catalog</a>.</li>
					<li>Launched features and ran daily bug triage for the leafly.com site, working with two development teams, customer service, editorial, sales & marketing, and internal operations teams.</li>
					<li>Improved design and product processes including running design sprints, as well as introducing 1-pagers and other product documentation to the company</li>
				</ul>

				<p>At Google from 2013-2016, I worked on two enterprise software producs: <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/solutions/digital-marketing/search/">DoubleClick Search</a>, an SEM management tool typically used by large search marketing agencies; and <a href="http://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a>, a computing infrastructure for software developers and large companies building large-scale  distributed software.</p>

				<p>My contributions included:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>As a <b>people</b> manager, I recruited, hired, mentored, and coached junior and senior designers and user researchers, and helped three of my direct reports get promoted. I've also had to manage low performers, which was harder than that other stuff by far. I received a 94% postive rating from my direct reports in a Google manager's survey in 2015.</li>
					<li>I helped establish and update design <b>processes</b> for both teams, including running informal design critiques and day- to week-long design sprints, as well as approving final design work for production. Prototyping is a particular interest of mine, and I was one of a grassroots team that built an Angular.js-based prototyping framework used to create hundreds of prototypes at Google.</li>
					<li>Worked closely with product managers and engineering leaders to establish <b>product</b> visions, typically as mockups or functional prototypes. I've run numerous <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">design sprints</a> with busines and technical leads, both for "big bets" and small features. On DoubleClick Search, I also shipped a number of features as a Senior UX designer.</li>

				<p>As the Design Manager of Amazon's Core Shopping UX team in 2011-2013, I helped set the design vision for the site's most important pages and features including the homepage, product detail pages, checkout experience, and other strategic projects. The samples here represent the best work my team  produced.</p>
				<p>My design team:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Launched a major redesign of Amazon's global navigation</li>
					<li>Delivered substantial bottom-line revenue on product detail pages, checkout, and other programs</li>
					<li>Evolved Amazon's visual design language and front-end frameworks</li>
					<li>Provided a modern shopping UX vision for the company</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I also helped foster the growth and health of the design community across Amazon. I started  regular company-wide forums for designers to share and discuss work; I hosted a guest speaker series; and I organized the company's first UX conference.</p>

				<p>Between 2008-2011 I was the Senior UX Designer for Amazon's retail checkout experience. I led a major redesign of the Shopping Cart in 2010-11, one of the most-visited pages on the site. I'm most proud that this was design-driven project. It grew out of some blue-sky redesign work our design team had done where I'd built a live-data prototype in PHP that demonstrated a dramatically simpler Cart user interface and client-side list management actions.</p>
				<p>The prototype here is the design I delivered to the engineering team. Note that the live Cart has been iterated on quite a bit by my design team since this version launched.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Move all list management actions to the client, substantially reducing pageviews per session</li>
					<li>Simplified the overall UI, while adding key product information</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Every purchase worldwide on Amazon.com, except 1-Click orders, goes through this page, but it hadn't been updated in years. My 2010 redesign focussed on clarifying the information heirarchy and laying the foundation to start moving secondary checkout interactions like address selection into lightweight modal states of this page.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Reduced average time to checkout by improving page legibility and simplifying the most common interactions on the page.</li>
					<li>Reduced pageviews per purchase.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The Order Placement page handles a huge number of use cases. To manage that complexity, I built a custom prototyping framework that routed URLs to Javascript templates and loaded data from JSON objects. This let me cover new use cases by editing a couple of small text files rather than rebuilding dozens of Photoshop files. (This was before popular Javascript MVC frameworks like Backbone or Angular existed.)</p>

				<p>The Payment Page was the first major project I worked on as Senior UX Designer for the Checkout program in 2009. This page lets customers create, validate, and choose from payment methods. As in the examples above, we worked to move common interactions to the client side, significantly reducing customers' time and effort. We were surprised to find that <em>adding</em> friction to a critical task led to increased success (can you spot where?). While the design is starting to show its age, I'm proud that this design has held up without major changes.</p>
